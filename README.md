# Local SNP query in PhenoScanner
Code to handle dbsnp147 data used for local queries in PhenoScanner

## INTRODUCTION

This is a small repository to show how I handle the dbsnp147 data that PhenoScanner allowed me to have access to. The dbsnp147 data can only be obtained by asking PhenoScanner to give you a link to download it. This repository only shows the code to divide the data so that it can be queried easily in R and to query it to obtain chromosome, position and RSID from build 37. **That means that the original dbsnp147 data cannot be found in this repository, nor cannot be obtained by using this code, as agreed with PhenoScanner after obtaining it.**
